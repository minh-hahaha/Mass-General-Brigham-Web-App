- **React Router** for client-side navigation
- **Tailwind CSS** for modern, responsive styling
- **Google Maps API** integration for external navigation
- **Three.js** for 3D hospital visualization
- **React Bootstrap** for UI components

### Backend (`apps/backend/`)
- **Node.js** with Express.js for RESTful API development
- **TypeScript** for type safety and better development experience
- **Prisma ORM** for database operations with PostgreSQL
- **Multiple pathfinding algorithms** (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, A*) for navigation
- **Google Cloud Text-to-Speech** integration for accessibility
- **Groq AI API** integration for natural language processing
- **JWT authentication** with OAuth2 bearer tokens

### Database (`packages/database/`)
- **PostgreSQL** for robust data storage
- **Prisma schema** defining hospital entities and relationships
- **Complex relational models** for employees, departments, service requests, and navigation nodes

### Shared Packages (`packages/`)
- **Common constants** and shared types
- **Database client** for consistent data access
- **Shared utilities** across frontend and backend

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
- **PostgreSQL** database
- **Git** for version control
- **Yarn** package manager (v4.7.0)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/minh-hahaha/Mass-General-Brigham-Web-App.git
   cd Mass-General-Brigham-Web-App
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
  - Corepack should come installed with npm. If corepack is missing, run `npm 
    install --g corepack` to install corepack.
   ```bash
   corepack enable
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   yarn setup
   ```
   This creates the necessary `.env` files for local, WPI, and production environments.

4. **Configure PostgreSQL**
   - Ensure PostgreSQL is running locally
   - Default credentials: `postgres` / `postgres` / `postgres`
   - Update credentials in `.env` files as needed

5. **Initialize the database**
   ```bash
   yarn workspace database push
   ```

6. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

The application will be available at:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:3000
